# João - Developer in Progress 🚀

Hello! My name is João, and I'm progressing in my journey through the world of programming. Currently, I live in Sweden 🇸🇪 and am exploring various technologies to develop my skills. In my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube videos 📺, playing video games 🎮, watching series or movies 🎬, and browsing social media 📱.

## 🚀 Skills

- **Languages**: JavaScript (beginner to intermediate level)
- **Test Automation Tools**: I have experience with **Cypress** 🐞, **Postman** 📬, and **Selenium** 🕸️, though I'm still honing my skills in these tools.
- **Front-End Development**: Completed a front-end development course 🌐, and you can find some related projects in my repository.
- **Back-End Development**: Currently enrolled in a back-end development course 🔧 to expand my knowledge and skills.
- **Continuous Learning**: I'm always looking to learn more about programming and software development 📚.

## 📚 Projects

Here you'll find some of my early projects and experiments as I continue my learning journey. I enjoy working on small projects that allow me to practice my skills and explore new technologies 🔍.

## 🎯 Goals

My goals include becoming proficient in programming and QA, and ultimately becoming a **web developer** 💻 and, in the future, a **full-stack developer** 🌍. I'm interested in opportunities where I can apply what I'm learning and grow even further 🌱.
